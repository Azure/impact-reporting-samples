## Onboarding Azure Impact Reporting (Preview) app

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] A valid account with necessary access permissions to an Azure tenant and Dynatrace environment.
- [ ] Access to the latest app binary from the [releases folder](../releases/).
- [ ] You must have the app-engine:apps:install permission in your Dynatrace environment.
- [ ] Have [run the impact reporting script in Azure](#run-the-impact-reporting-onboarding-script-in-azure)

#### Run the Impact Reporting Onboarding script in Azure

##### Permissions Needed on Azure to run the deployment script

Ensure you have Contributor permission in subscription(s) that you choose to onboard for Impact Reporting. You also need 'User Access Administrator or Role Based Access Administrator' permission to assign the 'Impact Reporter' and 'Monitoring Reader' role to the Entra App that will be used to report impacts from these subscriptions.

###### The deployment script does the following:-

    a) Registers the resource provider Microsoft.Impact and associated feature flag for Impact Reporting within the customers' Azure subscription(s).
    b) Optionally, creates a third-party Azure Entra App with a secure secret to ensure pipeline security. 
    c) Grant the app the 'ImpactReporter' and 'Monitoring Reader' permissions on subscription(s).

###### Running the onboarding script

1) Download the scripts from the [scripts folder](../scripts/).
2) Onboarding single subscription

   Shell script

        ./azure-impact-reporting-onboarding.sh --subscription_id <subscription id> 

    Powershell

        ./AzureImpactReportingOnboarding.ps1 -SubscriptionId <subscription id> 

3) Onboarding multiple subscriptions

    Shell script

        ./azure-impact-reporting-onboarding.sh --file-path <file path to the file that has new line separated list of subscriptions to be onboarded>

    Powershell

        ./AzureImpactReportingOnboarding.ps1 -FilePath <file path to the file that has new line separated list of subscriptions to be onboarded>
4) Note the output of the script as it will be required in upcoming steps.

    b) Search for 'Limit outbound connections' 
    c) Add the following to the list:

#### 2. To Upload and install your app in Dynatrace

2) The customer should log in to their preferred Dynatrace environment
   1) Open the Hub app
   2) Navigate to the Manage tab
   3) Click the upload button
   4) Select the app artifact from the file picker
   5) Confirm the installation. To complete this step, the user must have the app-engine:apps:install permission.

The app will require the following permissions from Dynatrace

    app-settings:objects:write: To write to app settings values for tenant and credential information required to report impacts and fetch insights.
    environment-api:credentials:read: To read credential value that is used to get the access token for accessing the Microsoft APIs for reporting impacts and fetching insights.

    automation:workflows:read: Read the created workflow that is used to report impacts.
    storage:entities:read: Read azure resource related information to report impact against.

As this app creates a workflow that triggers on a problem and does query execution using DQL to fetch additional details associated with a problem, there is a small cost incurred. Please review costing details here: [Rate Card](https://www.dynatrace.com/pricing/rate-card/)
